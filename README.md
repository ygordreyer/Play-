## Achievement System Development

This fork is focused on implementing RetroAchievements support in Play!, with features including:
- Memory monitoring and achievement tracking
- Hardcore mode support
- Save state management
- Integration with RetroAchievements API

The implementation is designed to be:
- Optional (can be enabled/disabled at build time)
- Non-intrusive to core emulation
- Performance conscious
- Well tested

Once complete, this work will be submitted back to the main project.
